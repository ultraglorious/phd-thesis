# Ph.D. thesis

It is widely believed that auroras are created when particles streaming outward from the sun strike Earth's atmosphere.  A key issue with this explanation is that many possible follow-up questions cannot be answered without conceding that the explanation is largely untrue.  Without devolving into pedantry, the reality is quite different.  This solar wind is more like the wind that powers a windmill.
